    "With some high-street stores across London announcing plans to open new branches in the immediate vicinity of transport hubs - particularly, railway stations, it is prudent to analyse the kinds of businesses operating in the area.

An analysis of most visited businesses close to railway stations will help some companies or individuals decide on how to take advantage of the yearly increase in passenger traffic.\n",
